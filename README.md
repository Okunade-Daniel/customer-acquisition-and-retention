# Overview
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing channels and languages for Bionic Enterprise, a company that offers a subscription-based service. The project uses data from a campaign that ran in January 2018, where 7309 customers were sent advertising messages through various channels and languages. The project also evaluates the retention rate of the customers who subscribed to the service.
# Data and Methods
The data for this project contains information about the customers who were targeted by the campaign, such as their age, preferred language, marketing channel, and whether they subscribed or not. The file also contains information about the customers who subscribed, such as their retention status after six months.
The methods used for this project include descriptive statistics and data visualization. The project uses Power BI for creating reports for the project.
# Results
The results of the data analysis are presented in a Power BI report. Some of the main findings are:
•	The campaign achieved a 14% conversion rate, with 1030 customers subscribing to the service out of 7309 targeted customers.
•	The most used marketing channel was House Ads, followed by Facebook, Instagram, Push, and Email. However, the most effective marketing channel in terms of conversion rate was Email, followed by Push, Facebook, Instagram, and House Ads.
•	The most preferred language was English, followed by Spanish, German, and Arabic. However, the most effective language in terms of conversion rate was German, followed by Arabic, English and Spanish
•	The conversion rate was higher on weekends than on weekdays, suggesting that customers had more time to go through the advert on weekends.
•	The retention rate of the customers who subscribed was 68%, meaning that 68% of the customers remained loyal to the service.
•	The retention rate varied by age group, marketing channel, language, and day of week. The highest retention rate was observed for customers aged 19-24, who received the advert via Email, in their preferred language, and on Monday.
# Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the results of the analysis, the following conclusions and recommendations can be made:
•	Attracting and retaining customers hinges greatly on various factors, with one of the most salient being the age of the target audience. Young people, particularly those between 19-24 years old, are more inclined to respond to the company's offers and remain loyal to the enterprise in the long haul. Thus, it is imperative for Bionic Enterprise to focus its marketing efforts on meeting the needs and preferences of this youthful demographic.
•	The language used in an advertisement also plays a pivotal role in procuring and preserving customers. Customers are more inclined to respond positively and remain loyal when adverts are presented in their preferred language. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that Bionic Enterprise customizes its advertisement language according to the target audience and leverages language detection tools that will ensure the optimal presentation of adverts in customers’ preferred language.
•	Where and when an advert is sent is also a vital determinant of customer acquisition and retention. Sending advertisements over the weekends increases the likelihood of customers subscribing while sending them at the beginning of the week fosters stronger customer loyalty. As such, Bionic Enterprise should optimize its timing strategy by experimenting with various day-channel combinations to yield maximum results.
